The Advanced Inventory Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to optimize inventory processes for hardware companies. The system integrates features like real-time inventory tracking, predictive analytics for demand forecasting, and seamless supply chain management. It also incorporates product management (cataloging, pricing, and version control) and staff management (employee tracking, role assignment, workload distribution, and shift scheduling) to ensure efficient operations. With a focus on data-driven insights, it enables businesses to minimize waste, reduce costs, and meet customer demands effectively. Built with scalability and adaptability in mind, this project highlights skills in data analysis, system design, and collaborative problem-solving.
